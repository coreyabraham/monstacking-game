# Monstacking
## Brief
A silly stacking game made entirely within the [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/) between 7 developers for an education subject; "Virtual and Extended Realities"!

## Background
This is the entire game archived on GitHub in regards to the game's development throughout the few weeks it was actively being developed! As of right now, this project was only tested on a Meta Quest 2 VR Headset and _may not_ run on other Virtual Reality devices, you can give it a shot though of course, though I don't garantee it'll work!

## Usage
Simply git cloning the respository link: [.git URL]("https://github.com/coreyabraham/monstacking-game.git") to download the source of the project, or head on over to the Releases page to download the latest (and known working) version of the project as a `.apk` file!
